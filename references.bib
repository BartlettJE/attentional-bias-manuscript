	abstract = {Psychologists must be able to test both for the presence of an effect and for the absence of an effect. In addition to testing against zero, researchers can use the two one-sided tests (TOST) procedure to test for equivalence and reject the presence of a smallest effect size of interest (SESOI). The TOST procedure can be used to determine if an observed effect is surprisingly small, given that a true effect at least as extreme as the SESOI exists. We explain a range of approaches to determine the SESOI in psychological science and provide detailed examples of how equivalence tests should be performed and reported. Equivalence tests are an important extension of the statistical tools psychologists currently use and enable researchers to falsify predictions about the presence, and declare the absence, of meaningful effects.},

	abstract = {Individual differences in cognitive paradigms are increasingly employed to relate cognition to brain structure, chemistry, and function. However, such efforts are often unfruitful, even with the most well established tasks. Here we offer an explanation for failures in the application of robust cognitive paradigms to the study of individual differences. Experimental effects become well established – and thus those tasks become popular – when between-subject variability is low. However, low between-subject variability causes low reliability for individual differences, destroying replicable correlations with other factors and potentially undermining published conclusions drawn from correlational relationships. Though these statistical issues have a long history in psychology, they are widely overlooked in cognitive psychology and neuroscience today. In three studies, we assessed test-retest reliability of seven classic tasks: Eriksen Flanker, Stroop, stop-signal, go/no-go, Posner cueing, Navon, and Spatial-Numerical Association of Response Code (SNARC). Reliabilities ranged from 0 to .82, being surprisingly low for most tasks given their common use. As we predicted, this emerged from low variance between individuals rather than high measurement variance. In other words, the very reason such tasks produce robust and easily replicable experimental effects – low between-participant variability – makes their use as correlational tools problematic. We demonstrate that taking such reliability estimates into account has the potential to qualitatively change theoretical conclusions. The implications of our findings are that well-established approaches in experimental psychology and neuropsychology may not directly translate to the study of individual differences in brain structure, chemistry, and function, and alternative metrics may be required.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Attentional bias to drug cues is thought to contribute to maintenance of drug-use behavior among chronic drug users. Studies assessing this bias traditionally have assessed drug cues that are explicitly presented in a laboratory setting. This study tested the use of a mobile eye-tracking procedure to assess visual attention to smoking cues by smokers and non-smokers in a more naturalized environment.
Methods: A mobile eye-tracker was used to assess the number and duration of ﬁxations made to smoking cues located in an ofﬁce space environment by smokers and non-smokers while completing a sham experimental task. Smokers completed two sessions, once after 12 h of abstinence and once after smoking.
Results: Results indicated that smokers made signiﬁcantly more ﬁxations to the smoking cues than non-smokers, regardless of smoking condition though the mean amount of time spent ﬁxating on the cues did not differ significantly. Smokers did not differ in the number of ﬁxations or mean ﬁxation duration across the two smoking conditions, suggesting in this sample that a 12-h period of abstinence did not make the smoking cues more salient in this context.
Conclusion: This study demonstrates the successful use of mobile eye-tracking to assess attentional biases to environmental drug cues. Results suggest that smoking cues in the environment are potentially more attention grabbing for smokers compared to non-smokers but these cues do not necessarily hold visual attention of smokers longer than that of non-smokers.},

	abstract = {Much evidence documents that individuals with emotional and drug-use disorders demonstrate biased attention toward stimuli associated with their disorder. This bias appears to diminish following successful treatment. Two studies examined whether current cigarette smokers show biased attention toward smoking-related images compared with non-smokers (Studies 1 and 2) and whether this bias is less pronounced in former smokers (Study 2). Attentional bias toward cigarette-related photographs was examined using the dot-probe task. Pairs of images (one smoking-related) appeared side by side for 500 ms on a computer screen prior to the presentation of a probe (an asterisk) replacing one of the photographs. Subjects struck a key as quickly as possible to indicate the probe location. Attentional bias was defined as faster reaction times when the probe replaced the smoking-related image. In both studies, current smokers displayed significantly greater attentional bias toward cigarette stimuli than did non-smokers. Former smokers in Study 2 displayed an intermediate level of bias, but did not differ significantly in bias score from either of the other groups. These results support further use of the dot-probe task as a measure of attentional bias in non-abstinent smokers and in individuals undergoing smoking cessation treatment. \# 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

	abstract = {Measures of cue reactivity provide a means of studying and understanding addictive behavior. We wanted to examine the relationship between different cue reactivity measures, such as attentional bias and subjective craving, and functional brain responses toward smoking-related cues in smokers. We used eye-tracking measurements, a questionnaire for smoking urges-brief and functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess the responses to smoking-related and neutral visual cues from 25 male smokers after 36 h of smoking abstinence. Regression analyses were conducted to determine the correlation between cue-evoked brain responses and the attentional bias to smoking-related cues. The eye gaze dwell time percentage was longer in response to smoking-related cues than neutral cues, indicating signiﬁcant differences in attentional bias towards smoking-related cues. The attentional bias to smoking-related cues correlated with subjective craving ratings (r = 0.660, p b 0.001). The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the putamen, the posterior cingulate cortex and the primary motor cortex were associated with the attentional bias to smoking-related cues, whereas the orbitofrontal cortex, the insula and the superior temporal gyrus were associated with smoking-related cue-induced craving and smoking urges. These results suggest that attentional mechanisms in combination with motivational and reward-related mechanisms play a role in smoking-related cue reactivity. We conﬁrmed a positive correlation between different smoking-related cue reactivities, such as attentional bias and subjective craving, and functional brain responses in various individuals. Further studies in this ﬁeld might contribute to a better individualized understanding of addictive behavior.},

Objective: These theoretical views were evaluated by examining cognitive biases in smokers. Methods: We monitored the eye movements of 41 smokers (predominantly young adults, who smoked from one to 40 cigarettes per day) as they completed a visual probe task in which smoking-related and matched control pictures were presented. Participants also completed a stimulus-response compatibility task, which measured the tendency to approach smoking-related cues, and a rating task. Results: Smokers with lower levels of nicotine dependence showed greater maintained attention and faster approach responses to smoking-related cues. Longer gaze times for smoking cues were associated not only with lower levels of nicotine dependence, but also with higher levels of craving.

	abstract = {Introduction: Among cigarette smokers, lower levels of consumption, deﬁned as smoking fewer cigarettes per day (CPD) or not smoking daily, are becoming more common. The relationship between cigarette consumption and smoking frequency (daily or nondaily) is not well characterized, and the natural history of light smoking (deﬁned here as smoking ≤10 CPD) is poorly understood.
Methods: We assessed changes in CPD and smoking frequency over time among light smokers (≤10 CPD) and very light smokers (≤5 CPD), using a population-based longitudinal survey of 3,083 adult smokers in Massachusetts who were interviewed three times over a 4-year follow-up period (in 2000–2001, 2002–2003, and 2005–2006). We used logistic regression to identify factors associated with light smokers’ progression to heavier smoking or smoking reduction/ quitting.
Results: Seventy percent of very light smokers were nondaily smokers. Very light nondaily smokers differed from very light daily smokers by younger age, higher socioeconomic status, a social smoking pattern, later smoking initiation, less evidence of nicotine addiction, and more recent and planned cessation efforts. Very light nondaily smokers and smokers consuming 6–10 CPD were more likely to remain in the same smoking category and were less likely to increase consumption than were very light daily smokers. Factors independently associated with increasing consumption among very light smokers were smoking daily, nicotine dependence, White ethnicity, social smoking, and having more friends who smoked; among smokers consuming 6–10 CPD, male gender and lack of quitting self-efficacy were associated with increasing consumption. Cigarette consumption in the United States has been declining steadily over several decades (Orzechowski \& Walker, 2003). Lower levels of cigarette smoking, whether deﬁned as smoking fewer cigarettes per day (CPD) or not smoking on a daily basis, are becoming more common among U.S. smokers (Porter, Jackson, Trosclair, \& Pederson, 2003). As of 2006, approximately 20\% of current smokers did not smoke every day (Rock et al., 2007) compared with just less than 17\% in 1992 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1994). Epidemiological studies consistently show a dose response for most adverse health outcomes related to smoking (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services [USDHHS], 2004). However, light smoking, generally deﬁned as smoking no more than 10 CPD, still increases cardiovascular morbidity and mortality as well as all-cause mortality (Bjartveit \& Tverdal, 2005; Kawachi et al., 1994; Luoto, Uutela, \& Puska, 2000; Okuyemi et al., 2002; Prescott, Scharling, Osler, \& Schnohr, 2002; Rosengren, Wilhelmsen, \& Wedel, 1992), even at very low levels of cigarette smoking (e.g., ≤5 CPD or smoking less than daily; Bjartveit \& Tverdal, 2005; Kawachi et al., 1994; Rosengren et al., 1992). These health implications underscore the importance of understanding the pattern and natural history of light smoking, particularly because light smoking is common among young smokers, whose smoking patterns may still be developing (Biener \& Albers, 2004; Shiffman, Kassel, Paty, Gnys, \& ZettlerSegal, 1994; USDHHS, 1994). In different individuals, light smoking may be a stable pattern of tobacco use, an intermediate step on the route to heavier and therefore riskier smoking, or a step leading to cessation. The smoker characteristics that are predictive of each of these outcomes are unclear. Identifying which light smokers are likely to increase consumption is of critical importance to both public health and public policy.
Conclusion: Our ﬁndings indicate that most light smoking is},

	abstract = {Background: Nondaily smokers are a growing subpopulation of smokers. Current cessation guidelines were developed for daily smokers, and how clinicians might help nondaily smokers is not clear.
Methods: Analyzing the 2000 National Health Interview Survey in 2004, we compared characteristics of nondaily smokers with never smokers and daily smokers. We used multivariate logistic regression to compare predictors of wanting to quit in 6 months between nondaily and daily smokers.
Results: About one in ﬁve current smokers was a nondaily smoker. Nondaily smokers reported better health than daily smokers, but had some health status indicators suggesting worse health than never smokers. Nondaily smokers were more likely to want to quit (odds ratio [OR]ϭ1.31, 95\% conﬁdence interval [CI]ϭ1.10 –1.56) than daily smokers, but were less likely to report a physician having asked about tobacco use (41\% vs 50\%, p Ͻ0.0001) or advised quitting (31\% vs 41\%, p Ͻ0.0001). In both nondaily and daily smokers, physician advice (nondaily ORϭ1.50, 95\% CIϭ1.03–2.2; daily ORϭ1.58, 95\% CIϭ1.32–1.89), and the belief that secondhand smoke harms others (nondaily ORϭ1.48, 95\% CIϭ1.04 –2.1; daily ORϭ1.80, 95\% CIϭ1.56 –2.1), predicted wanting to quit. Higher-educated nondaily smokers were less likely to want to quit (ORϭ0.54, 95\% CIϭ0.32– 0.91), unlike in daily smokers (ORϭ1.48, 95\% CIϭ1.15–1.89). Latino nondaily smokers were less likely (ORϭ0.43, 95\% CIϭ0.30 – 0.64) than whites, and African-American daily smokers were more likely (ORϭ1.27, 95\% CIϭ1.04 –1.55) than whites, to want to quit.

	abstract = {Objectives To determine whether the European Commission Eurobarometer survey of 27 European Union (EU) member states produces reliable smoking prevalence estimates when compared to national prevalence survey data, and to identify approaches to standardising the measurement of smoking prevalence in the EU.
Methods This was a direct comparison of questions, sampling methods and smoking prevalence estimates, between the 2006 Eurobarometer study and contemporaneous national surveys. All 27 EU member states were included. Participants were people surveyed in the 2006 Eurobarometer study and in various national surveys in the closest year to 2006 for which data were available. The main outcome measures were the mean and range of differences in prevalence estimates between the Eurobarometer and national surveys.
Results Most national surveys used similar multistage sampling methods and involved sample sizes of 3000 or more, but the phrasing of the questions used to deﬁne smoking, the inclusion or exclusion of occasional smokers, the age ranges of participants and the frequency of national surveys varied substantially between countries. The Eurobarometer study used the same questions in all countries but in sample sizes of 1000, or in 3 countries, 500. Eurobarometer 2006 smoking prevalence estimates were on average 0.37 percentage points higher than those in national surveys, but with a 95\% range from À10.49 to +11.23 percentage points. At the extremes, the equivalent national prevalence estimate for Slovakia was 13.0\% higher and for the UK 10.0\% lower than the Eurobarometer ﬁgure.
Conclusions Measurements of the prevalence of smoking, the biggest avoidable public health threat in the European Union, are highly discrepant within countries between national and European Commission survey estimates. Monitoring national smoking prevalence on a regular basis, using standardised methods in representative population samples, is an urgent priority for the EU.},

	abstract = {Aims There is a growing interest in very low rate [fewer than one cigarette per day (CPD)] and light (one to nine CPD) smokers and in some parts of the world their numbers appear to be increasing. This paper examined changes in prevalence over the past 5 years, cessation patterns, and smoking and demographic characteristics of very low rate, light and moderate-to-heavy (10+ CPD) smokers in England. Design Cross-sectional and longitudinal data from aggregated monthly waves of a household survey: the Smoking Toolkit Study. Setting England. Participants A total of 23 245 smokers interviewed between November 2006 and May 2011 and 4147 who provided data at 6-month follow-up. Measurements We compared the demographic and smoking characteristics between the three groups of smokers at baseline, and the rate of attempts to quit, use of aids to cessation and success of quit attempts at follow-up. Findings Very low rate smoking remained extremely rare (1.9\% of smokers in 2006 to 2.8\% in 2011), but light smoking became increasingly common (23.9–32.8\%). Compared with moderate-to-heavy smokers, very low rate and light smokers were younger, more often female and from a higher socio-economic background. They were more motivated to quit and enjoyed smoking less. During the 6-month follow-up period, light smokers, but not very low rate smokers, were more likely to attempt to quit than moderate-to-heavy smokers. When they tried to quit, very low rate and light smokers used aids to cessation less than moderate-to-heavy smokers but still used them to a substantial degree: 18\%, 31\% and 44\% used over-the-counter nicotine replacement therapy in their most recent quit attempt for the three types of smoker, respectively. Even very low rate smokers had a substantial failure rate: 65\% failed in their most recent quit attempt within 6 months. Conclusions Very low rate (fewer than one cigarette per day) and light (one to nine cigarettes per day) smokers in England are at least as motivated to quit as heavier smokers. Although they use cessation medication less than heavier smokers and are more likely to succeed, they still use such medication and fail in quit attempts to a substantial degree.},

	abstract = {Background: Non-daily or intermittent smoking is becoming common, but little is known about smoking patterns of intermittent smokers (ITS). This study assesses differences in the proﬁle of smoking motives of non-daily, ITS and daily smokers (DS).
Methods: Participants were 218 DS and 252 ITS (152 converted ITS [CITS], who previously smoked daily, and 80 native ITS [NITS] who did not), not currently quitting, recruited by advertisement. ITS were deﬁned as smoking 4–27 days per month; DS as smoking daily, 5–30 cigarettes per day. Participants completed the Wisconsin Inventory of Smoking Dependence Motives (WISDM), yielding scores for 13 different motives. The within-proﬁle standard deviation expressed proﬁle scatter (differentiation among motives), and proﬁle shape was assessed on scores standardized for within-proﬁle mean and standard deviation.
Results: There was no difference between ITS and DS on proﬁle scatter. ITS and DS differed in the shape of the standardized score proﬁle, with DS scoring higher on Tolerance, Craving, Automaticity, Loss of Control and Behavioral Choice motives, and ITS scoring higher on Cue Exposure, Weight Control, and Positive Reinforcement motives. CITS did not differ from NITS in proﬁle scatter or proﬁle shape.
Conclusion: ITS differ from DS in the relative importance of motives, with ITS emphasizing motives associated with acute, situational smoking, and DS emphasizing dependence-related motives. Among ITS, history of daily smoking did not inﬂuence the proﬁle of motives.},

In this study, we describe the demographics, smoking history, and smoking behavior of ITS (n=282; 50.2\% male) in comparison to daily smokers (DS; n=233; 60.7\% male). Within ITS, we also compare “converted” ITS (CITS), who had previously smoked daily, with “native” ITS (NITS). On average, ITS were 34.66 years of age, and had smoked 42,850 cigarettes in the course of an average of 18 years of smoking. They smoked an average of 4.38 days per week, consuming 4.39 cigarettes a day on smoking days, and demonstrated considerable day-to-day variability in cigarette consumption. Almost half of ITS had Fagerstrom Test of Nicotine Dependence scores of 0, indicating no dependence. Compared to DS, ITS were more likely to cite alcohol drinking, socializing and being with other smokers as common contexts for smoking, and they also more often cited being angry or stressed. Data suggested that ITS’ behavior was not explained by use of other nicotine products or by economic constraints on smoking, nor by differences in psychological adjustment. Within ITS, CITS were heavier, more frequent, and more dependent smokers. In many respects, CITS were intermediate between NITS and DS. ITS show distinct patterns of smoking behavior that are not well explained by current models of nicotine dependence.},

Subjects recorded each cigarette on an electronic diary, and situational variables were assessed in a random subset (n = 21,539 smoking episodes); parallel assessments were obtained by beeping subjects at random when they were not smoking (n = 26,930 non-smoking occasions). Compared to DS, ITS’ smoking was more strongly associated with being away from home, being in a bar, drinking alcohol, socializing, being with friends and acquaintances, and when others were smoking. Mood had only modest effects in either group. DS’ and ITS’ smoking were substantially and equally suppressed by smoking restrictions, although ITS more often cited self-imposed restrictions. ITS’ smoking was consistently more associated with environmental cues and contexts, especially those associated with positive or ‘‘indulgent’’ smoking situations.

Additional stratified analyses were conducted to identify any variables that might moderate the association between craving and attentional bias. The primary meta-analysis indicated a significant, albeit weak (r = . 19), association between attentional bias and craving. Stratified analyses revealed that the association was larger for illicit drug and caffeine craving than for alcohol and tobacco craving, larger for direct measures of attention (eye movement measures and event-related potential measures) than for indirect behavioral measures of attentional bias, and larger when craving strength was high than when it was low (all ps {\textless} .05). The size of the correlation did not differ among patients in treatment and individuals who were not seeking treatment.

We review the relevant evidence and present an integration of existing theoretical models to explain the development, causes, and consequences of addiction-related attentional biases. We suggest that through classical conditioning, substance-related stimuli elicit the expectancy of substance availability, and this expectancy causes both attentional bias for substance-related stimuli and subjective craving. Furthermore, attentional bias and craving have a mutual excitatory relationship such that increases in one lead to increases in the other, a process that is likely to result in substance self-administration. Cognitive avoidance strategies, impulsivity, and impaired inhibitory control appear to inﬂuence the strength of attentional biases and subjective craving. However, some measures of attentional bias, particularly the addiction Stroop, might reﬂect multiple underlying processes, so results need to be interpreted cautiously. We make several predictions that require testing in future research, and we discuss implications for the treatment of addictive behaviors.},

	abstract = {Previous laboratory studies have investigated associations between attentional bias and craving, but ecological momentary assessment (EMA) may provide ecologically-valid data. This study examines whether clinic-measured attentional bias is associated with noticing smoking cues, attention to smoking, and craving assessed by EMA and whether EMA-assessed cues and attention to smoking are associated with craving in a secondary analysis of data from 100 cigarette smokers attempting cessation. Two weeks before quitting, participants completed attentional bias assessments on visual probe (VP) and Stroop tasks and completed random EMA-assessments for seven weeks thereafter. Participants completed 9,271 random assessments, averaging 3.3 prompts/day. Clinic-measured attentional bias was not associated with cues seen (VP: OR = 1.00, 95\% CI = [0.99, 1.01]; Stroop: OR = 1.00, 95\% CI [0.99, 1.00]), attention toward smoking (VP: OR = 1.00, 95\% CI [0.99, 1.02]; Stroop: OR = 1.00, 95\% CI [0.99, 1.00]), or craving (VP: OR = 1.00, 95\% CI [0.99, 1.02]; Stroop: OR = 1.00, 95\% CI [0.99, 1.01]). EMA responses to seeing a smoking cue (OR = 1.94, 95\% CI [1.74, 2.16]) and attention toward smoking (OR = 3.69, 95\% CI [3.42, 3.98]) were associated with craving. Internal reliability was higher for the Stroop (α = .75) than visual probe task (α = .20). In smokers attempting cessation, clinic measures of attentional bias do not predict noticing smoking cues, focus on smoking, or craving. However, associations exist between noticing smoking cues, attention toward smoking, and craving assessed in the moment, suggesting that attentional bias may not be a stable trait.

Our goal is to provide a starting point for the perception researcher who is keen on assessing this tool for their own research goals. Internet-based testing has several advantages over in-lab research, including the ability to reach a relatively broad set of participants and to quickly and inexpensively collect large amounts of empirical data, via services such as Amazon’s Mechanical Turk or Prolific Academic. In many cases, the quality of online data appears to match that collected in lab research. Generally-speaking, online participants tend to be more representative of the population at large than those recruited for lab based research. There are, though, some important caveats, when it comes to collecting data online. It is obviously much more difficult to control the exact parameters of stimulus presentation (such as display characteristics) with online research. There are also some thorny ethical elements that need to be considered by experimenters. Strengths and weaknesses of the online approach, relative to others, are highlighted, and recommendations made for those researchers who might be thinking about conducting their own studies using this increasingly-popular approach to research in the psychological sciences.},

Pros: rapid data collection, potential to sample from non-WEIRD participants 
Cons: lack of control over stimulus parameters (e.g. screen size / resolution)
Gosling and Mason (2015) - overview of online psychological research 

Benefits

Easy access to large pools of participants

Nicholls et al. (2014) - students who receive course credit are less motivated than those who get paid 
Online participants are similar to undergraduate participant pools in terms of WEIRDness and education, and probably more experienced in taking part in experiments.


Speed of data collection 
Economical 

Research has shown little relationship with reward and effort, only increased sign up rate. 


Online research is not going to take over lab research, but it provides a great complement. 

Following up a lab based study with an online study offers the opportunity to explore the generalisability of the findings, or extend it to a larger sample. 



Comparing online and lab research

Germine et al. (2012) replicated five tasks which were supposed to be susceptible to lapses in concentration. 
Similiar results found by Crump et al. (2013) for RT based tasks. 
Very short SOAs ({\textless} 90ms) may not be a good idea for online research. Although this may improve as technology improves. 
Simcox and Fiez (2014) showed that similar numbers of online participants would be required to reach similar levels of power in a lab study. This was to test the idea that poorer data quality in online studies could be offset by more participants.

Potential concerns 

Stimulus timing 

They report the browser doesn't know when the screen refreshes. According to Gorilla, this problem has been largely fixed. 
Presenting for multiples of 16.95ms will help accuracy.
Auditory presentation faces similar issues. 


RTs

Reimers and Stewart (2014) - the noise introduced by the variability of browsers and keyboards only slightly reduces the statistical power of online studies. 
Providing that there are not excessive resources being used, browser based recordings are roughly as accurate as lab based studies (Simcox and Fiez 2014).


Variability in hardware 

The sheer variety of hardware and software used by participants could be an issue. 


Random responding 

Might they complete the study without the same care and due diligence of a lab based participant?
Oppenheimer et al. (2009) - 46\% of lab participants failed to complete an attention check. 



Recommendations to myself:

Make sure I record what software/hardware a participant is using. 
Try and find a way to standardise stimulus dimensions? 
Ethics - make sure their IP address or identifiable information is not available on data sharing.

Concerns about data quality are heightened for performance-based cognitive and perceptual measures, particularly those that are timed or that involve complex stimuli. In experiments run with uncompensated, anonymous participants whose motivation for participation is unknown, reduced conscientiousness or lack of focus could produce results that would be difficult to interpret due to decreased overall performance, increased variability of performance, or increased measurement noise. Here, we addressed the question of data quality across a range of cognitive and perceptual tests. For three key performance metrics—mean performance, performance variance, and internal reliability—the results from self-selected Web samples did not differ systematically from those obtained from traditionally recruited and/or lab-tested samples. These findings demonstrate that collecting data from uncompensated, anonymous, unsupervised, self-selected participants need not reduce data quality, even for demanding cognitive and perceptual experiments.},

Online data collection = opportunity to collect large and broadly generalizable data sets with minimal resource investment 
The validity of response time data collected online is less established.
RQ: can self selecting samples be compared with lab-based participants? Slight difference to my study, as this is looking at those who are uncompensated. PRevious research has not falsified the notion that web data are noisier than lab data. 

Methods 

Data collected via testmybrain.org. Provides personalised feedback in exchange for study participants. The data for the three studies in this paper were from three different batteries. 
My study: get participants to indicate what device they were using. Able to detect if they were using an inappropriate device. 
A wide variety of tasks were used with different properties such as requiring stimulus control, focused attention, and participant honesty. 
Study 1 - Variability across samples. 

How do web samples compare to lab based in response variability? 
4080 web participants. 


Study 2 - age and sex matched samples

Small but non-zero differences in age and gender for study one. Wanted to compare performance in age and sex matched samples. 
Female, 18-21 year old college students for lab sample. Web samples filtered to match. 


Study 3 - self-selected versus recruited samples 

Compared the same tests, but compared method of recruitment as lab samples might take participation more seriously. 
Randomly samples the web participants to match an Australian twin registry. 



Results 

Study 1

Reliability and variance similar for all comparisons. Greater variance in web, but also greater reliability. No systematic mean differences between web and lab samples. 


Study 2

Mean scores similar for some tasks, but lower for the web on others. CIs overlap substantially between the two samples. 
Variance and reliability were similar across samples. 
Matching the samples actually impacted the variance of the web sample, and results were closer unmatched. 
Comparable data quality in age and sex matched web and lab samples. 


Study 3 

Mean performance similar for some tasks, but higher in the web sample for others. Variance and reliability largely similar, but for one test reliability was higher in the web samples.  
Difference in results likely due to lower IQ in twin sample, rather than differences in data quality. 



Discussion 

Web samples can provide comparible data quality to lab based samples on performance measures, even in participants who are anonymous and not rewarded. 
The tests chosen required accurate timing, sustained attention, and participant honesty. If there was a systematic difference in web participants, it should have affected data quality. 
The most important thing is quality assurance. Exclude participants with self-reported cheating, technical difficulties, inappropriate equipment, and repeat performance.

However, relative to traditional laboratory studies, many aspects of the testing environment are not under the experimenter's control. In this paper, we attempt to empirically evaluate the fidelity of the AMT system for use in cognitive behavioral experiments. These types of experiment differ from simple surveys in that they require multiple trials, sustained attention from participants, comprehension of complex instructions, and millisecond accuracy for response recording and stimulus presentation. We replicate a diverse body of tasks from experimental psychology including the Stroop, Switching, Flanker, Simon, Posner Cuing, attentional blink, subliminal priming, and category learning tasks using participants recruited using AMT. While most of replications were qualitatively successful and validated the approach of collecting data anonymously online using a web-browser, others revealed disparity between laboratory results and online results. A number of important lessons were encountered in the process of conducting these replications that should be of value to other researchers.},

While Mechanical Turk has been used extensively for surveys, less was known about how viable it would be to use for experiments used in cognitive science / cognitive psychology. 
Two key challenges: technical challenges such as ensuring the compatiblity of the participant's computer and task, and lack of control over the testing environment. 
Aim: to validate mechanical Turk for being used in behavioural cognitive research. However, the main difference here is they are interested in the qualitative replication of theoretically significant findings. 
Positives of MT

Quick data collection 
Minimises experimenter effects by limiting contact 
MT workers are more diverse than undergraduates. 
What internet research lacks in control, it makes up for in standardization and control over experiment procedures. 


Limitations of MT

Anonymous, so cannot verify demographics. 
Precision of each participant's hardware is unknown and likely highly variable. 
Lack of control over testing environment. 


Solutions 

Introduce screening questions to detect dots / inattentive participants. 



Methods
Section 1: reaction time experiments

Keyboard and monitors have different timing properties. But the timing errors should be relatively small and should not systematically differ across participants. 
All the tasks use here require accurate response timing: Stroop, task-switching, Eriksen Flanker, Simon, and Posner. 
All tasks are approximately 5 minutes long and contain approximately 100 trials. 

Stroop. 40 Ss. Validated by typing a sentence as quickly as possible. Had to be 40 words per minute. 
Task switching costs. 55 Ss. Faster and more accurate performance for a repeated task, more errors when task is alternated. 
Flanker. 52 Ss. 
Simon. 58 Ss. Measures spatial compatibility effects in choice-reaction time. Compatible location and response locations. 



Section 2: Rapid stimulus presentation

The programming is capable of accurate stimulus presentation, but there can be differences in displays and connection quality. 
The tasks used here require rapid stimulus presentation 10-100ms. 
Visual cuing and inhibition of return

Detect target stimulus appearing on the left or right. Prior to onset, there is short informative or uninformative cue to the location of the stimulus. 
50 Ss. 


Attentional blink 

Target detection can be impaired for a second target that appears within 100-500ms of the first target. 
52 Ss. 


Masked priming 

This relieson extremely short presentation durations that normally have to be validated with external hardware. The shortest prime duration was 16ms. 
32 Ss but 572 trials. 



Results
Section 1: reaction time experiments

Stroop 

Low error rates and replicated the effect. Slower RTs on incongruent trials. 


Task switching 

RTs were significantly faster for repeat than switch trials. Generally lower error rates. 


Flanker 

RTs significantly faster for compatible trials than incompatible trials. Low error rates. 


Simon 

RTs were significantly faster for compatible trials than incompatible. Low error rates.



Section 2: Rapid stimulus presentation

Visual cuing and inhibition of return 

The effects were replicated, and show that even small ({\textasciitilde}20ms) effects can be reliably detected using online presentation. Food for thought for my study: it may be able to detect 20ms difference, but my SEOI is 5-10ms?


Attentional blink 

There was the characteristic lag pattern where proportion correct responses was higher for lag 1 than 2. Lag 2 is worst, and performance gradually increases as lags increase. 


Masked priming 

The results were largely replicated, but not when the prime duration was lower than 64ms. This suggest any stimulus presentation under 64ms is not recommended. 



Section 3: learning studies

Category learning was investigated. Participants gradually improved performance, but reached asymptote around 20\% error rate. This was much lower than lab studies, but it wasn't the case that MT learned more slowly. Many subjects failed to master the task. 
They attempted to replicate the other study but as a function of reward magnitude (low versus high). The incentive condition had little effect on overall learning rates. Payment does not appear to have a strong effect on the quality of data. However, it did increase the rate of sign up and decreased the drop-out rate in the high incentive group. 
One interesting method could be to include manipulation check questions at the end of the instructions in order to check the participants understand the instructions. Building in checks for understanding the instructions is critical for ensuring high quality data. 
 

Discussion 

For accurate response measures, all tasks replicated successfully with low error rates. 
Recommendations:

Provide fair pay for high sign up and low drop out rate. 
Make the tasks at least somewhat fun and engaging. 
Do not exclude participants unless under the most obvious cases of abuse. Important not to make post-hoc decisions on data exclusion. One solution is to test the participants comprehension of instructions. This increased the data quality more than higher pay. 
Report drop-out rate. This will be higher than lab based studies.

The Internet offers many potential benefits to conducting smoking and other health behavior research with young adults. Questions, however, remain regarding the psychometric properties of online self-reported smoking behaviors. The purpose of this study was to examine the reliability and validity of self-reported smoking and smoking-related cognitions obtained from an online survey.

Methods
Young adults (N = 248) age 18 to 25 who had smoked at least 1 cigarette in the past 30 days were recruited online and completed a survey of tobacco and other substance use.

Results
Measures of smoking behavior (quantity and frequency) and smoking-related expectancies demonstrated high internal consistency reliability. Measures of smoking behavior and smoking stage of change demonstrated strong concurrent criterion and divergent validity. Results for convergent validity varied by specific constructs measured. Estimates of smoking quantity, but not frequency, were comparable to those obtained from a nationally representative household interview among young adults.

Conclusions
These findings generally support the reliability and validity of online surveys of young adult smokers. Identified limitations may reflect issues specific to the measures rather than the online data collection methodology. Strategies to maximize the psychometric properties of online surveys with young adult smokers are discussed.},

Good = great inclusion of hidden populations, and rapid responses from participants. 
Hughes (2010) - evaluating tobacco use via the internet 
RQ = can commonly used measures used in face to face interviews have similar psychometric properties when conducting on the internet? 
Crucial: this study is interested in daily and non-daily smoking. 

Methods

Cross-sectional survey using three internet based recruitment methods. 
18-25 years old, and smoking at least one cigarette in the past 30 days. 
Participants indicated number of cigarettes smoked in the past 24 hours, 7 days, and average number of CPD. Daily smokers = those smoking 7 days per week on average. 

Results 

From 940 providing consent, 248 provided smoking data and 181 completed the entire survey. 
Sample average 9.3 CPD, 4.7 years of smoking. 
Reliability 

All correlations between smoking variables were significant. Correlation between items on smoking questionnaire and time line follow back were {\textgreater} .80. 


Construct validity 

In daily smokers, greater number of CPD was correlated with higher FTCD score, but only r = .21. For non-daily smokers, greater CPD was correlated with years smoked (.35), but not FTCD. 


Criterion validity 

Daily smokers more likely to be unemployed and less likely to be a full-time student than non-daily smokers. No association with gender or ethnicity, contrary to some research.  



Discussion 

Smoking-related information demonstrated strong reliability and validity (yes reliability, validity more open to judgement). 
Strong relationships between smoking questionnaire and timeline followback. Suggests smaller number of questions can be effective. 
Measures of CPD had better convergent validity for daily smokers than non-daily smokers. 
There was little evidence of convergent validity in FTCD. It has little association with other smoking characteristics. 
Moran et al. (2004) - FTCD may not be good for non-daily smokers.
Associations between demographic variables and daily/nondaily smoking status were consistent with prior epidemiological studies, apart from gender and ethnicity. 
Limitations: could not validate with biological data. Recall errors are the same as other self-report methods.

Despite its popularity, very few published studies have examined psychometric properties of the task, including test-retest reliability, and no previous study has examined reliability in clinically anxious samples or systematically explored the effects of task design and analysis decisions on reliability. In the current analysis, we utilized dot-probe data from three studies where attention bias towards threat-related faces was assessed at multiple (≥5) timepoints. Two of the studies were similar (adults with Social Anxiety Disorder, similar design features) while one was much more disparate (pediatric healthy volunteers, distinct task design). We explored the effects of analysis choices (e.g., bias score calculation formula, methods for outlier handling) on reliability and searched for convergence of findings across the three studies. We found that, when considering the three studies concurrently, the most reliable RT bias index utilized data from dot-bottom trials, comparing congruent to incongruent trials, with rescaled outliers, particularly after averaging across more than one assessment point. Although reliability of RT bias indices was moderate to low under most circumstances, within-session variability in bias (attention bias variability; ABV), a recently proposed RT index, was more reliable across sessions. Several eyetracking-based indices of attention bias (available in the pediatric healthy sample only) showed reliability that matched the optimal RT index (ABV). On the basis of these findings, we make specific recommendations to researchers using the dot probe, particularly those wishing to investigate individual differences and/or single-patient applications.},

AB indexes assume that there is a stable trait like bias towards or away from a set of stimuli. This expects it to behave like an individual differences variable that can be summarised with one score. 
Look into AB variability in order to quantify how attentional bias fluctuates within a session. 
Meta analytic mean of groups sizes = 20 per group from Bar-Haim et al. (2007). This would support my rationale of my new study being the largest AB study to date. 

Methods

They report three studies which each used three trial types: congruent (dot replacing threat), incongruent (dot replacing non-threat), and neutral (dot replacing unrelated neutral).
Study 1 

29 participants, 12 measurements, two times per week for 6 weeks. 
16 images, 500ms SOA. Images presented vertically, not horizontally. Probe differentiation version. SN or NS 80\% of trials, NN 20\%. 320 trials overall in two 160 blocks. 32 trials per NS/SN picture pair? 


Study 2

15 participants, 8 measures, two times per week for four weeks. 
Same as study 1, but only one block of 160 trials. 


Study 3

Healthy controls. 28 participants, 5 measurements within a 14 week period. 
2000ms SOA, NN trials consisted of two blanks ovals. Probe location version. 16 trials per trial type to create 48 trials. 


Reliability analysis

Examined the joint effects of outlier handling and bias index calculation. Outlier handling = cut-offs ({\textless}200/300 \& {\textgreater} 2500/3000 or ± 2/3 SDs) {\textgreater} or rescaling (windzoring). 
Examined the impact of top versus bottom dot performance.
Attentional bias variability = separated into bins of 20 trials, and incongruent-congruent index was calculated for each bin. The SD of the indices was then calculated and divided by the mean RT to correct for variance in RTs. This provides the within-subject, within-session variability of bias.


Reliability index

Test-retest reliability was assessed via ICC. 



Results

Effect of outlier handling 

There was no consistent improvement for a single strategy of outlier handing across the three data sets. Windsorizing offering a more consistent benefit across the three studies. 
The Incongruent versus congruent bias score for bottom dot trial was the highest ICC across all studies. 
ICCs tended to be higher for eye tracking measures than RT measures. 



Discussion 

There was a consistent bias to threat faces across the studies. 
When a normal bias index was calculating, using one location (bottom dot) provided better reliability estimates. This was robust across studies and outlier handling methods. It may be due to reducing error variance, while between-subject variance remained the same. 
Attention may have been drawn to the top face, and as the bottom face required a saccade, it is more likely to reflect a bias in attentional disengagement. 
Recommendation: focus on dot bottom trials, or use horizontally presented stimuli. 
Rescaling through windsorizing was the best and most consistent method. 
They suggest the task can be streamlined, but this does not sound like a good recommendation, unless in clinical populations with smaller attention spans. 
The attentional bias variability index exhibited vastly superior stability across all three data sets. This was affected by trials, and the optimal stability came with 320 trials. This sounds to me like it's just measuring the SEM. More trials = better accuracy. 
Clinical recommendations: even the best ICCs were very poor ({\textless} .2). A single assessment point of visual probe data is likely to have low power to detect a relationship with other constructs of interest. This limits its usefulness as a clinical measure.
Vast literature to differentiate between groups, but almost certainly a huge file drawer problem. 
Eye tracking was more reliable even with fewer trials.
Overall recommendations: 

Use the normal incongruent - congruent trial index using bottom dot trials. 
Rescale outliers rather than excluding them. 
Administer as many sessions as possible. 
Quantify within-session variability in bias
Use eye tracking where possible

Expectations: lab studies will have greater attention from Ss, but socially desirable responding will be higher in the labs. 
Methods

435 undergraduate political science students. Ss were randomly assigned to do the study online or in the lab. 


Results

Higher response rates online (88\%) compared to in the lab (77\%).
Instructional manipulation check was very similar for both lab and online Ss. Manipulation checks lower in both samples, but no differences (based on non-sig p values).
No substantial difference in internal consistency across the samples. 
Online participants had higher levels of self-reported distraction (use of cell phone, browse internet, talk with another person, watch TV, listen to music). More distracted but no apparent differences in attention. 
There was little evidence that mode of completion affected socially desirable responding. 
There is some evidence that online students were more likely to cheat, as they have higher scores and a weaker correlation between prior interest and knowledge.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Behavioural researchers are increasingly conducting their studies online to gain access to large and diverse samples that would be difficult to get in a laboratory environment. However, there are technical access barriers to building experiments online, and web-browsers can present problems for consistent timing -- an important issue with reaction time-sensitive measures. For example, to ensure accuracy and test-retest reliability in presentation and response recording, experimenters need a working knowledge of programming languages such as JavaScript. We review some of the previous and current tools for online behavioural research, and how well they address the issues of usability and timing. We then present The Gorilla Experiment Builder (gorilla.sc) a fully tooled experiment authoring and deployment platform, designed to resolve many timing issues, and make reliable online experimentation open and accessible to a wider range of technical abilities. In order to demonstrate the platform9s aptitude for accessible, reliable and scalable research, we administered the task with a range of participant groups (primary school children and adults), settings (without supervision, at home, and under supervision, in schools and public engagement events), equipment (own computers, computer supplied by researcher), and connection types (personal internet connection, mobile phone 3G/4G). We used a simplified flanker task, taken from the Attentional Networks task (Rueda et al., 2004). We replicated the 9conflict network9 effect in all these populations, demonstrating the platform9s capability to run reaction time-sensitive experiments. Unresolved limitations of running experiments online are then discussed, along with potential solutions, and some future features of the platform.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Miller et al. (2018) - new browsers have comparable RTs to the lab, even in domestic environments. 
How Gorilla fixes timing issues

If there are any problems with connection speed, Gorilla loads several trials in advance from the start until the end of the task.
Gorilla times each frame's actual duration rather than assuming it will be 16.667ms. 


Study one successfully replicated the flanker effect with effects of less than 100ms. This requires accurate stimulus presentation and response collection. 
There was no significant difference between groups, despite taking place in children across different class rooms, and the amount of distractions around. 
Study two did not permit access on a tablet or phone. 
The effect was 29.1ms and online studies may produce smaller differences due to the variance in testing environment. Online participants could also be more attentive leading to smaller within-subject variance.
The timing is good in Gorilla, but limited by the sampling rate of the hardware being used. On individual trials, it will not be possible to have accuracy below 8ms. 

 

Gorilla will provide a breakdown of the Browser, operating system, and the viewport characteristics of the web browser (horizontal and vertical pixels).

Such persistent preconceptions are based on arguments referring to increased variation, the limits of certain software and technologies, and a noteworthy lack of comparisons (between Web and lab) in fully randomized experiments. To provide a critical test, participants were randomly assigned to complete a lexical decision task either (a) in the lab using standard experimental software (E-Prime), (b) in the lab using a browser-based version (written in HTML and JavaScript), or (c) via the Web using the same browser-based version. The classical word frequency effect was typical in size and corresponded to a very large effect in all three conditions. There was no indication that the Web- or browser-based data collection was in any way inferior. In fact, if anything, a larger effect was obtained in the browser-based conditions than in the condition relying on standard experimental software. No differences between Web and lab (within the browser-based conditions) could be observed, thus disconfirming any substantial influence of increased technical or situational variation. In summary, the present experiment contradicts the still common preconception that reaction time effects of only a few hundred milliseconds cannot be detected in Web experiments.},

Studied the word frequency effect in lexical decisions (frequent words detected faster than nonwords). Suitable as the effects are only 150-200ms. 
Three conditons: implemented in the lab, low tech online applications in Javascript and HTML in the lab, and web based outside the lab. 
67 participants: 28 participants in web/browser, 20 in lab/browser, and 19 in lab/e-prime condition. 

Results

RTs slightly smaller in the lab. Variance was lowest in lab/browser and highest in web/browser. Suggests its not due to the technology, but rather environmental distractions. 
All effects replicated with large effect sizes. Mean difference higher in lab/eprime, but Cohen's d higher in lab/browser (due to lower variability). 
Including the condition in a 3 x 2 ANOVA, there was an effect of word/non-word, but no effect of condtion. 

Discussion

The effect was typical in size across all conditions, significant, and large Cohen's d. The effects were roughly equivalent across all conditions.

The interpretation of effect sizes—when is an effect small, medium, or large?—has been guided by the recommendations Jacob Cohen gave in his pioneering writings starting in 1962: Either compare an effect with the effects found in past research or use certain conventional benchmarks. The present analysis shows that neither of these recommendations is currently applicable. From past publications without pre-registration, 900 effects were randomly drawn and compared with 93 effects from publications with pre-registration, revealing a large difference: Effects from the former (median r = .36) were much larger than effects from the latter (median r = .16). That is, certain biases, such as publication bias or questionable research practices, have caused a dramatic inflation in published effects, making it difficult to compare an actual effect with the real population effects (as these are unknown). In addition, there were very large differences in the mean effects between psychological sub-disciplines and between different study designs, making it impossible to apply any global benchmarks. Many more pre-registered studies are needed in the future to derive a reliable picture of real population effects.},

	abstract = {Objective
The study objective was to identify biobehavioral variables associated with greater intake of nicotine and a tobacco carcinogen among Black light smokers who smoke 1 to 10 cigarettes per day (CPD).
Methods
We analyzed baseline data collected from 426 Black light smokers enrolled in Kick It at Swope III (KIS III), a smoking cessation trial for Black smokers. We examined differences in concentrations of tobacco biomarkers, including urinary total nicotine equivalents (TNE) and total 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3)pyridyl-1-butanonol (NNAL; a human carcinogen), across gender, age, plasma nicotine metabolite ratio (NMR), CPD, and measures of tobacco dependence, including time to first cigarette (TFC), using ANOVA.
Results
Tobacco biomarker levels were significantly higher among those who smoked more CPD (6–10 vs 1–5 CPD) and those with greater reported physical dependence on tobacco. Concurrently, those who smoked 1–5 CPD smoked each cigarette more intensely than those who smoked 6–10 CPD. While we found no gender differences overall, among those who smoked 1–5 CPD, women had higher NNAL levels compared to men. The rate of nicotine metabolism, measured by the nicotine metabolite ratio, was not significantly related to TNE or NNAL levels.
Conclusion
Among Black Light smokers, higher cigarette consumption and greater physical dependence—but not rate of nicotine metabolism, menthol use, or socioeconomic status—were associated with greater toxicant exposure and thus a likely increased risk of tobacco-related diseases. The lack of data on light smokers, and specifically on Blacks, make this observation important given the disproportionate burden of lung cancer in this population.},

Specifically, numerous articles claimed to demonstrate either that (1) attentional bias measured in treatment settings could predict subsequent relapse to substance use, or (2) direct modification of attentional bias reduced substance use and improved treatment outcomes. In this paper, we critically evaluate empirical studies that investigated these issues. We show that the evidence regarding both of these claims is decidedly mixed, and that many of the studies that appear to yield positive findings have serious methodological and statistical limitations. We contend that the available literature suggests that attentional bias for drug cues fluctuates within individuals because it is an output of the underlying motivational state at that moment in time, but there is no convincing evidence that it exerts a causal influence on substance use. Future research should make use of experience sampling methodology to characterise the clinical significance of fluctuations in attentional bias over time.},

There is growing interest in cognitive biases related to substance use, but evidence from the anxiety literature suggests that tasks commonly used to assess these may suffer from low internal reliability. We examined the internal reliability of the visual probe and modified Stroop tasks.

Setting
Human laboratory study.
Participants
Healthy volunteers (n=408 across seven independent studies) recruited from the general population on the basis of alcohol or tobacco use.
Measurements
Visual probe and modified Stroop task measures of substance-related cognitive bias.
Findings
Measures of cognitive bias for substance-related cues, as assayed by the visual probe and the modified Stroop tasks, may not be reliable. In particular, the visual probe task showed poor internal reliability, as did unblocked versions of the modified Stroop task.
Conclusions
The modified Stroop task is preferable to the visual probe task as a measure of substance-related cognitive bias, on the basis of its psychometric properties. Studies using cognitive bias tasks should not assume they are reliable, and should routinely report reliability estimates where possible.},

	abstract = {Psychological science relies on behavioral measures to assess cognitive processing; however, the field has not yet developed a tradition of routinely examining the reliability of these behavioral measures. Reliable measures are essential to draw robust inferences from statistical analyses, and subpar reliability has severe implications for measures’ validity and interpretation. Without examining and reporting the reliability of measurements used in an analysis, it is nearly impossible to ascertain whether results are robust or have arisen largely from measurement error. In this article, we propose that researchers adopt a standard practice of estimating and reporting the reliability of behavioral assessments of cognitive processing. We illustrate the need for this practice using an example from experimental psychopathology, the dot-probe task, although we argue that reporting reliability is relevant across fields (e.g., social cognition and cognitive psychology). We explore several implications of low measurement reliability and the detrimental impact that failure to assess measurement reliability has on interpretability and comparison of results and therefore research quality. We argue that researchers in the field of cognition need to report measurement reliability as routine practice so that more reliable assessment tools can be developed. To provide some guidance on estimating and reporting reliability, we describe the use of bootstrapped split-half estimation and intraclass correlation coefficients to estimate internal consistency and test-retest reliability, respectively. For future researchers to build upon current results, it is imperative that all researchers provide psychometric information sufficient for estimating the accuracy of inferences and informing further development of cognitive-behavioral assessments.},

Objectives: This study aimed to define empirically the effects of abstinence and smoking in adolescent smokers, using indices validated in adult smokers. Methods: Subjects were 16 young novice smokers (five male, 11 female), ages 14–18 years. A modified Stroop task measured the ability to inhibit attention to smoking-related cues; the classic Stroop task measured the ability to inhibit a pre-potent response (i.e. reading a word); a rapid information processing (RIP) task measured vigilance. Results: Abstinence increased and smoking decreased the intrusiveness of smoking cues. Parallel effects were seen in commission errors on the RIP task. These effects were restricted to heavier smokers ({\textgreater}11 cigarettes/day). Subjective withdrawal effects predicted the intrusiveness of smoking words during abstinence. The number of cigarettes smoked per day predicted the beneficial effect of smoking on the classic as well as modified Stroop tasks. The physiological effects of abstinence and smoking predicted RIP performance. Conclusions: Abstinence impairs and smoking improves inhibitory information processing in young novice smokers in a manner similar to adult smokers. Daily frequency of smoking is a critical moderator of these effects.},

The relation between each FTQ item and biochemical measures of heaviness of smoking was examined in 254 smokers. We found that the nicotine rating item and the inhalation item were unrelated to any of our biochemical measures and these two items were primary contributors to psychometric deficiencies in the FTQ. We also found that a revised scoring of time to the first cigarette of the day (TTF) and number of cigarettes smoked per day (CPD) improved the scale. We present a revision of the FTQ: the Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND).},

	abstract = {Background and Aims A range of experimental paradigms claim to measure the cognitive processes underpinning alcohol use, suggesting that heightened attentional bias, greater approach tendencies and reduced cue-specific inhibitory control are important drivers of consumption. This paper identifies methodological shortcomings within this broad domain of research and exemplifies them in studies focused specifically on alcohol-related attentional bias. Argument and analysis We highlight five main methodological issues: (i) the use of inappropriately matched control stimuli; (ii) opacity of stimulus selection and validation procedures; (iii) a credence in noisy measures; (iv) a reliance on unreliable tasks; and (v) variability in design and analysis. This is evidenced through a review of alcohol-related attentional bias (64 empirical articles, 68 tasks), which reveals the following: only 53\% of tasks use appropriately matched control stimuli; as few as 38\% report their stimulus selection and 19\% their validation procedures; less than 28\% used indices capable of disambiguating attentional processes; 22\% assess reliability; and under 2\% of studies were pre-registered. Conclusions Well-matched and validated experimental stimuli, the development of reliable cognitive tasks and explicit assessment of their psychometric properties, and careful consideration of behavioural indices and their analysis will improve the methodological rigour of cognitive alcohol research. Open science principles can facilitate replication and reproducibility in alcohol research.},

	abstract = {Historically, smokers were considered a single homogeneous group, but over the past two decades research has increasingly focused on differentiating daily and non-daily smokers. Despite fundamentally different smoking habits and motives, daily and non-daily smokers have similar cessation rates. In order to understand why both groups may experience a similar difficulty quitting smoking, this thesis explored neurocognitive mechanisms associated with addictive behaviour. In order to profile these mechanisms, a systematic review was conducted, highlighting there was a gap to address in two areas of research relating to drive and control. Study One (N = 60) and Study Two (N = 166) investigated attentional bias towards smoking cues using the visual probe task, finding there was no meaningful difference between daily and non-daily smokers in trait-level attentional bias. Study Three (N = 28) measured ERP components associated with inhibitory control (Go/NoGo task) and error processing (Eriksen Flanker task). There were no significant effects of interest, but the sample size was smaller than planned. This thesis made three contributions to the study of addictive behaviour. First, the systematic review highlighted that research investigating lighter and heavier smokers has a problematic level of heterogeneity in the definitions used to define the groups. Second, there was no meaningful difference in attentional bias between daily and non-daily smokers, supporting contemporary theories that attentional bias may be best conceptualised as a state-level construct. Finally, internal consistency estimates of the ERP measures of inhibitory control and error processing supported previous research reporting good psychometric properties. Overall, this thesis presented a focused profile of measures relating to drive and control neurocognitive mechanisms, but there were no meaningful differences between daily and non-daily smokers. If these mechanisms are important to addictive behaviour, future research will have to investigate their role using alternative designs.},

	abstract = {Cognitive -motivational models point to attention bias (AB) as an important factor in the persistence of problematic drinking behavior. Unfortunately, the measures that have been used to examine AB in addiction typically showed poor psychometric properties. To bring research on AB a critical step further it would be crucial to develop tasks with acceptable reliability and construct validity. Recently, Lazarov and colleagues (2016) developed a multi-stimulus free-viewing task (participants were free to look at any part of the screen and there was no secondary task involved) that showed excellent psychometric properties in the context of social anxiety as well as depression. We, therefore, adapted this task and examined its psychometric quality within the context of alcohol use. Participants with varying levels of alcohol use (N = 100) were presented with 54 matrices each containing 8 alcoholic and 8 non-alcoholic drinks. Each matrix was presented for 6 s. First fixation (100 ms) location and latency and total dwell time were assessed for alcohol and soda pictures. Assessment of AB, craving, and alcohol use (problems) was repeated after 3–8 days. Specifically, the dwell-time based AB-measure showed excellent internal reliability and considerable stability. Supporting the validity of the current AB-measures, it was found that participants with higher scores on craving and alcohol problems (i) dwelt longer on alcohol stimuli, and (ii) more often showed a first fixation on alcohol, whereas (iii) stronger craving was associated with shorter latency of first alcohol fixations. The AB-measure showed promising psychometric properties. Thus, this free-viewing eye-tracking task seems a welcome new tool for being used in future research on AB in addiction.},

	abstract = {A large subset of individuals who smoke cigarettes do not smoke regularly, but the assessments used to collect data on cigarette consumption in non-daily smokers have not been rigorously evaluated. The current study examined several self-report and biomarker approaches to the assessment of cigarette use in a sample of non-daily smokers (n=176). Participants were randomly assigned to a Daily Monitoring condition (n=89), requiring a Daily Report of the number of cigarettes smoked in the previous 24 hours, or a No Monitoring condition (n=87). Number of cigarettes smoked over the first 28 days of the study was assessed using two Quantity Frequency measures, a Graduated Frequency measure, and a Timeline Follow Back (TLFB) interview at the Session 5 study visit. Hair nicotine (NIC), hair cotinine (COT), and expired-air carbon monoxide (CO) were collected from each participant. Total cigarettes reported via Daily Report were strongly correlated with all Session 5 measures of total cigarettes, but were most strongly associated with TLFB total cigarettes. Collapsed CO across five sessions was the biomarker most strongly correlated with Daily Report total cigarettes. The results support the use of DR and TLFB methods of assessing cigarette use in non-daily smokers. Results also support the use of CO as appropriate biological markers of exposure in non-daily smokers, and point to some limitations in the use of hair biomarkers in this population.},
